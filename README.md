# Image-Classification-Using-CNN

This repository contains a project for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project demonstrates the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques, including hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation.

Features

	•	Implementation of a CNN model using Keras
	•	Training and testing on the CIFAR-10 dataset
	•	Performance optimization through hyperparameter tuning
	•	Evaluation metrics, including confusion matrix and accuracy plots

 How It Works

	1.	Data Preparation: Preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset, including normalization and splitting into training/testing sets.
	2.	Model Building: Define a CNN architecture using Keras.
	3.	Training: Train the model on the dataset, with hyperparameter optimization for improved performance.
	4.	Evaluation: Use accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix to validate performance.

Results

	•	Achieved high classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
	•	Optimized the model by experimenting with different hyperparameters and architectures.
